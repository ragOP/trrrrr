              Scientists’ role is to move us toward a better future. But what
              does that future look like? What does the next generation lab look
              like, who is standing in it and what problems will they be

              Thermo Fisher Scientific partnered with Savanta, a leading market
              research company, to understand what professionals in Life
              Sciences expect the world to look like in 2030. We conducted 20
              hour-long in-depth interviews and surveyed more than 600 Life
              Science professionals from the United States and Europe.
